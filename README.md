## About

Are you tired of opening an image/text/office/archive application, paste what you just copied, hit save, select the folder manually and type the filename, just to realise your transparent GIF became a static JPEG with black background?
Paste Into File helps you do all this in a single step, preserving transparency and animations.

With Paste Into File you paste clipboard contents directly into files via file explorer context menu and/or keyboard shortcut, and likewise copy file contents to the clipboard without opening the file.
It can also monitor the clipboard and automatically save or append content in a file/folder/zip as you copy things (batch processing).

_Note: On Windows 11, the context menu entries are located in the extended menu ("show more options"). Use Shift + right click to access it directly; or enable autostart and use keyboard shotcuts._

## Usage

When starting Paste Into File for the first time or after an update, the first launch wizard will guide through the configuration of context menu entry, hotkey, etc.

In addition to the instructions given below, help is also available via [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/eltos/PasteIntoFile/discussions/categories/q-a).


### Paste clipboard contents

This is the main mode of Paste Into File which allows saving clipboard contents directly into files.
To use this mode, run the program from the file explorer context menu, with the hotkey `WIN`+`ALT`+`V` (if enabled), from the tray (if enabled), from the start menu or via command line.
If **clipboard patching** is enabled, the regular paste command and `CTRL`+`V` hotkey can also be used.

If **autosave mode** is enabled, the file to paste will directly be created and selected for renaming.
Otherwise, a dialog will prompt for filename and type.
By holding `SHIFT` when the program starts, the autosave mode setting can be temporarily inverted (show the dialog even though autosave is enabled, or skip the dialog even though autosave is disabled).
When running Paste Into File from the start menu or tray, the dialog will always be shown.

The **filename template** can be edited from the dialog or via command line (see [below](#template-format) for a description of the available formats).
When holding `CTRL` while the program starts, the file will be saved to a subdirectory.
The corresponding template can be configured via command line (see below).

The available **file extensions** depend on the formats available in the clipboard.
For example, if you copy a range of cells from a spreadsheet, the data is available not only as text, but also in DIF, RTF, SLK and HTML formats and even as screenshot.
Either select one of the suggested or enter a custom extension (which will be remembered).
An appropriate format is then chosen automatically[^save_plain_text] and a preview shown.
When selecting `*` as extension or in autosave mode, the file extensions is determined automatically, i.e. the clipboard is saved as image, if available, or else as text. The format is determined by the last used extension for the respective filetype (which can also be set via command line).

A special **batch mode** exists to monitor the clipboard and save it every time new contents are copied.
If enabled, the filename is purely determined by the template (which supports a dedicated counter variable).

[^save_plain_text]: To force saving plain text data to a file with a special extension,
prepend a dot to the file extension (the actual filename will still have only a single dot).
For example, when copying syntax highlighted HTML code snippets from a browser,
using `html` will cause the html-formatted text to be saved,
while using `.html` will save the plain text.


### Paste into existing files (Append/Replace)
The context menu entry **Paste into this file (Append/Replace)** allows you to paste clipboard contents into existing files by either appending or replacing them.
This works as long as the clipboard contains data compatible with the selected file type.
In the case of replace, the old file is moved to the recycle bin and can be restored with the usual undo options of the file explorer (e.g. `CTRL-Z`).


### Copy file contents

To copy the contents of a file to the clipboard, use the file explorer context menu, the hotkey `WIN`+`ALT`+`C` (if enabled) or the command line option.
Currently, image and text files are supported. If the file format is not understood, an error message will be shown.
For non-text files, the file path is copied as text in addition to the image contents and file.


<a id="template-format"></a>
### Filename template format
The filename and/or subfolder template string may contain the following placeholders:
- `{0}`: The current date and time, e.g. `{0:yyyy-MM-dd HH-mm-ss}`.
    In addition to the [standard format specifiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings),
    `j` for day-of-year and `w` for week-of-year are supported.
- `{1}`: The save counter for batch mode. E.g. `{1:000}` for 3-digit zero padding. See [format specifiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-numeric-format-strings) for details.
- `{2}`: The clipboard text. E.g. `{2:15}` to limit it to 15 characters.
